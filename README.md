luksamuk/Templates
===================

Templates for various templates and resources for starting simple work.

DataStructures
--------------

Templates for data structures, such as lists, templates and stacks.
Be mindful that most of these templates might be simply obsolete, as some are
just too easy to program.

- List
- List (No Debug)
- Queue
- Stack

Gamedev
-------

Templates for Game Programming.

### C

Contains examples for building basic GPU backend on C/C++, using both OpenGL
and DirectX, with SDL1.2 and SDL2.

### D

Contains an example for building a basic OpenGL application, using DerelictSDL2.

### F\#

Contains an example for building a basic MonoGame application, on F# language.


### CommonLisp

Contains an example for building a basic SDL2+OpenGL window on Common Lisp.
Relies on Quicklisp for package management.

### GameDesignDocument

Contains an example for building a GDD, although this template is currently
outdated. I'll consider writing a class extension instead soon.


Misc
-----

Various other projects that never quite made it in size for their own repos in my portfolio.

### Huerizator

Some kind of encryptor/decryptor. Won't work with all characters, so you might get a segfault here and there. Doesn't use an efficient encryption either.

### UnfoldingFib

Small example of an unfolding Fibonacci sequence on a Seq structure, written in
F# script.
